# Master Thesis Repository

This repository contains all the files and code for my master thesis "Leveraging DSPy to Enhance Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing Applications". It is organized into several subfolders, each serving a specific purpose.

## Folder Structure


### `DSPy files/`

This folder contains the Python scripts that use the DSPy library for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

*   `NER_using_DSPy.py`: This is the main script for performing NER tasks using the DSPy framework.
*   `NER_using_Sentiment.py`: This script is a variation of the main NER script, which incorporates sentiment analysis and was used for further examples.

### `Logs`

Log files generated by the DSPy program runs are larger than 25 MB and therefore sepearately uploaded here https://fernuni-hagen.sciebo.de/s/5SJeE04cn7ZNWAt.

### `R-files/`

This folder contains the R scripts used for the statistical analysis of the results.

*   `hypothese_1.R`: R script for the statistical tests related to Hypothesis 1.
*   `hypothese_2.R`: R script for the statistical tests related to Hypothesis 2.
*   `hypothese_3.R`: R script for the statistical tests related to Hypothesis 3.

### `DSPy files/`

To run the `NER_using_DSPy.py` script, please follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    Navigate to the `DSPy files` directory and run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    pip install dspy-ai datasets litellm python-dotenv sentence-transformers
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment file:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following line:

    ```
    LOCAL_API=http://localhost:11434
    SERVER_API=any Open-AI-API compatible API-endpoint
    ```


3.  **Run the script:**

    Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    cd "DSPy files"
    python NER_using_DSPy.py
    ```

### `Statistical Results/`

This folder contains the results of the statistical analyses performed by the R scripts.

*   `hypothesis1_p_value_table.csv`: A table of p-values for Hypothesis 1.
*   `hypothesis_2_p_vals.csv`: A CSV file containing the p-values for Hypothesis 2.
*   `hypothesis_2_page_test.png`: A plot generated from the analysis of Hypothesis 2.
*   `hypothesis_2_plot.jpg`: Another plot for Hypothesis 2.
*   `hypothesis_3_plot.jpg`: A plot for Hypothesis 3.
